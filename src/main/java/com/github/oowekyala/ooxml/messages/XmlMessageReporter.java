/**
 * Reports errors in an XML document. This is meant as a helper
 * to carry around while validating an XML document. This interface
 * is the API provided to the validating code, what happens to the
 * messages is up to the implementation. Instances may wrap an
 * {@link XmlPositioner} to associate DOM nodes with a {@link XmlPosition position}
 * for better error messages.
 *
 * <p>A simple implementation is available in {@link DefaultXmlErrorReporter}.
 * Another implementation, {@link AccumulatingErrorReporter} holds
 * off the actual printing until the reporter is {@link #close() closed}.
 * Those implementations use {@link XmlMessageHandler} as a back-end
 * to render the messages.
 *
 * <p>The formatter used to template messages is implementation dependent,
 * as is the behaviour when the template argument array is null.
